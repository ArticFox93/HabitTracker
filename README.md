# Instructions

USERNAME = "type your username here"  # chance to someone have same name, try type unique username<br>
TOKEN = "type your token here"  # write a bunch of random letters (example - roweihdsfpfpod), min. 8-128 lettters<br>
GRAPH_ID = "type name of the graph"<br>

# Functions

add - you have to type here how long did you spent programming and it will automatically be added to the graph<br>
update - if you type wrong time spent, just run this command and it will overwrite it<br>
delete - it will delete that day in the graph if you had any record<br>

# Important

If you experience add, update or delete doesnt work, simply just run program again. Pixela has little thingy "api has 25% chance to be blocked because you arent pixela supporter".
