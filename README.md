# HabitTracker

Whats it about. Basically its https://pixe.la/ but in python. Its for track time activities. For example: you'll everyday type "how long" did you programming and it will be recorded in graph with statistic, average, etc.. (graph is so similar to githubs graph)

# Instructions

USERNAME = "type your username here"  # chance to someone have same name, try type unique username
TOKEN = "type your token here"  # write a bunch of random letters (example - roweihdsfpfpod), min. 8-128 lettters
GRAPH_ID = "type name of the graph"

# Functions

add - you have to type here how long did you spent programming and it will automatically be added to the graph
update - if you type wrong time spent, just run this command and it will overwrite it
delete - it will delete that day in the graph if you had any record

# Important

If you experience add, update or delete doesnt work, simply just run program again. Pixela has little thingy "api has 25% chance to be blocked because you arent pixela supporter".
